## About Project

This project was built as part of SheCodes coding bootcamp I partook in. Through creating this project I was able to familiarise myself with core concepts I'd been learning.\
• Used Props and useState to display weather information in app.\
• Used useEffect to call the data in an asynchronous way for the weather forecast.\
• Used .map() to manipulate the JSON file received from the API.\
• Used axios to make a call to the weather API.\
• Used Geolocation to determine the users weather for their current location.

## Lessons Learnt

Having finished this project, here are some key areas I feel I've developed in:\
• Making API calls and manipulating response data\
• Components, passing state and props to render\
• Creating layouts and components using Bootstrap

## Future Work

• Adding a small feature to each container which changes colour based on the temperature at the given location
